# Game_Build

A package built using PyGame that can either be a tool for learning Object-Orientated Python programming or just played as a simple-but-fun/annoying game. It also features my artistic interpretation of a cartoon coronavirus.

The objective of the game is to get to the pub by avoiding contact with COVID-19. Much like real-life, the more you visit the pub the harder it is to avoid COVID, so you may need to isolate (aka start from the beginning...)
